## ðŸŒ± Projects

Here are a few projects I've worked on so far:

-**[Hibbertz Surveys]:**(HTML/CSS/JavaScript, API, Firebase Auth & Firestore): I engineered/coded a responsive, web app that lets users complete daily surveys and earn micropayment rewards through BitLabs integration API. I integrated Firebase Authentication for secure, email-verified sign-up and protected routes, used Cloud Firestore for real-time storage of user data, survey responses, and balances, and deployed Firebase Cloud Functions to automate signup bonuses and referral rewards. On the admin side, I developed a dashboard for  question creation, data management, and analytics, and added gamification elementsâ€”signup bonuses, referral incentives, and in-app pop-upsâ€”to boost engagement and retention.
